# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Python is a high-level object oriented programming language. Some of its key features are that it comes with extensive libraries, free and open-source, easy to understand which leads to developers tending to opt to it for its all-rounded ability. Some of its effective use cases are Data Analysis, Machine learning, Web development with frameworks such as django and flask and most importantly Artificial Intelligence.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   In order to install python on an operating system in my case Windows, first visit the python.org site and download the latest version of python.
   After this clicking on the installer a launch setup wizard will pop up and complete. 
   Adding python to environment is also very important and that can be done by copying the python bin path to the nevironment variables.
   In order to verify installation we should see the python version by opening the command prompt and checking for it. 

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   I have attached the hello.py file and when explaining about it I would say that it comprises of a print function that is a built in function with parentheses and the lines of code Hello, World! is a string which is always in between double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   The basic data types in python are integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists and tuples.
   I have added a short script that explains  on the data types.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   In the if statement it only executes if the condition is met or true and continues to run if false.
   In the if-else case here we have different situations where it is both executable in both when the condition is true and false. 
   In the for loop it is used to iterate over a sequence of items and execute a block of
   code for each item in the sequence.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions are a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called upon when needed.
   The illustration is present in the pythonfunction.py.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   Lists are data types that store values in between square brackets in an ordered collection while dictionaries are associated with key value pairs which are comma seperated and in curly braces. The keys must be unique but the values can be duplicated.
   The illustrations are available in the list_and_dict.py.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Exception handling allows managing of errors and unexpected situations in code.
   The try block is used to execute a block of code and if an error occurs it is caught
   by the except block and the finally block is used to execute a block of code regardless of whether an error occurs or not.
   The illustration is provided in the exception_handling.py.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   Modules are a file containing a set of functions that can be imported into a script and packages are a collection of modules that can be imported into a script.
   In order to import a module one one has to use the import statement before the module's name. 
   The illustration is present in the import.py file.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    In order to read from a file we use the open function and the read function to read the content of the file and print it to the console.
    In order to write to a file we use the open function and the write function to write the content of the file and print it to the console.


# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
